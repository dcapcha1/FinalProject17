Game will provide an adventure for the player and give them many options to choose
The player will make several decisions that will affect their future.
The player, hopefully, is striving to make the best decisions, but a lot of the endings are bad endings.
There will be multiple endings depending on the decisions made in the game.
The game will largely consist of descriptions designed to immerse the player in an adventure.
More time is spent reading instead of doing. Enjoy the experience.
There is also some personalization. The player can input names of certain people they know and the code
will run using the given inputs, making a few endings a bit more personal.

Google- used to find out certain lines of code that I needed to use, such as \n to better format text
Gerstein- told me how to incorporate while loops to better run my code
